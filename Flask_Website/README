This is a website created using the Flask module, done through the guidance of this video:

I was able to learn a lot about web app building and building a web app with python on the backend, but it got me to think/realize that most of the coding that is shown
on this project is very insecure.

Some of the more obvious ones include:
  - a short session key
  - different messages for different failed logins (i.e. a right username and wrong pw gives a different msg from a wrong username and wrong passwd)
  - no account lockout
  - no MFA
  - weak passwords
  - no real input validation
 And the list goes on and on.
 My job is to now take this project, harden it, and then run a vulnerability assessment on the website. I will update the code in the next few weeks!
