This is version 2 of the Cipher_Block_Chaining obj
I wrote a CBC (cipher block chaining) encoder and decoder. It's a simplified version, but I managed to improve my original version. 
It now accepts: 

  any length of text (provided characters used are base64 characters) 
  a key with any set of characters (provided that characters used are base64 characters)
  an IV (in binary, == length of key). It will XOR block by block (in CBC fashion, not ECB) 
  
It wil then encrypt with the given key. It will also decode the same text provided that it is decoded by the same encoder/decoder object. Please check it out!
