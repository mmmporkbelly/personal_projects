This is the first code I have written without a prompt! It is a simplification of how CBC works.
This code does the following things: takes a key and IV, XORs and encrypts each block, and presents a cipher text. The decryption also works.
However, it does come with its limitations. It only works with base64 input and the inputted text has to be divisible by the key length. 
IV has to also match the key length.

I have also published this as a problem on codewars:
