# personal_projects

These are Python scripts I have written to improve my Python coding. As these are written at different points of my skills, they will show the progress of my Python comprehension. Many projects are derived from projects I have completed on CodeWars. All code is original. 

I have also included one JS project written from when I was learning JS for fun.
