This is a Vignere Cipher cracker. Currently, it only works on ciphertext containing only letters from the alphabet.

What is a Vignere Cipher? 

The Vigenère cipher is a classic cipher originally developed by Italian cryptographer Giovan Battista Bellaso and published in 1553. 
It is named after a later French cryptographer Blaise de Vigenère, who had developed a stronger autokey cipher (a cipher that incorporates the message of the text into the key).

The cipher is easy to understand and implement, but survived three centuries of attempts to break it, earning it the nickname "le chiffre indéchiffrable" or "the indecipherable cipher."

From Wikipedia:

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. 

It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

This cipher cracker includes an interface to input text directly or a txt file. First, it calculates all possible cipher key lengths by looking at the distance
between all three letter cells that repeat. Then, it calculates the highest common denominator for all distances, and calculates the length of the key.
The cracker then takes all possible key lengths and all possible keys, by analyzing the frequency of each letter in each key length iteration, and returns a list
of likely keys. It then decodes the text key by key.

If you would like to look at a simple decoder and encoder where you can create a class that stores the key and any alphabet you want to use, please look at

This project is a cumulation of multiple codewars problems I have solved.
