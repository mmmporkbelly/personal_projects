Girls will be your friends - theyll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - theyre your true best friends. Dont let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, theyll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you cant give up because if you give up, youll never find your soulmate. Youll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesnt mean youre gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you dont, then who will, sweetie?

Shes not perfect—you arent either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So dont hurt her, dont change her, dont analyze and dont expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when shes not there.”",Bob Marley,https://quotes.toscrape.com/author/Bob-Marley
