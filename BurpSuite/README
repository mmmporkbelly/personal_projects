Wrote another simple program to help with username/password lists in burpsuite! Some of the portswigger modules require you to get past some logic flaws using json input, sprinkling valid logins, and observing lockout attempts. As far as I can tell, the burpsuite community edition doesn't include any user friendly options to edit their lists in intruder mode in this manner, so I wrote a program to automate some of these list edits
